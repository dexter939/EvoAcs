# Sistema ACS (Auto Configuration Server)

## Overview
The ACS (Auto Configuration Server) project is a carrier-grade system built with Laravel 11, designed to manage over 100,000 CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) devices. It supports a comprehensive suite of protocols including TR-069 (CWMP), TR-369 (USP), TR-104 (VoIP), TR-140 (Storage), TR-143 (Diagnostics), TR-111 (Device Modeling), TR-64 (LAN-Side Configuration), TR-181 (IoT Extension), TR-196 (Femtocell), and TR-135 (STB/IPTV). Its core functionalities include device auto-registration, zero-touch provisioning, firmware management, and advanced remote diagnostics. The business vision is to deliver a highly scalable and performant solution for large-scale device management in telecommunication environments.

## User Preferences
I prefer clear and concise explanations. When making changes, prioritize core functionalities and ensure backward compatibility. I prefer an iterative development approach, focusing on delivering functional components incrementally. Please ask for confirmation before implementing significant architectural changes or altering existing API contracts. Ensure all new features have comprehensive test coverage. I want the agent to use proper markdown formatting in all its responses.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The web interface uses the Soft UI Dashboard Laravel template, providing a modern, responsive design with navigation and real-time statistics. It includes 12 statistics cards and 4 interactive Chart.js visualizations (Devices Status, Tasks, Diagnostics, Firmware). Device management features filtering, pagination, and modal forms for CRUD operations. The dashboard auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.

- **TR-181 (IoT Extension) Support**: Smart home device management supporting ZigBee, Z-Wave, WiFi, BLE, Matter, and Thread protocols, including IoT service automation.
- **TR-196 (Femtocell) Support**: Full femtocell RF management with GPS location tracking, UARFCN/EARFCN configuration, TxPower control, and Radio Environment Map (REM) scanning.
- **TR-135 (STB/IPTV) Support**: Set-Top Box provisioning with support for various frontends and streaming protocols (RTSP/RTP/IGMP/HLS/DASH), including QoS monitoring.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized indexes.
- **Asynchronous Queue System**: Laravel Horizon with Redis queues for provisioning, firmware deployment, and TR-069 requests.
- **API Security**: All API v1 endpoints are protected using API Key authentication.
- **RESTful API (v1)**: Provides authenticated endpoints for device management, provisioning, firmware, remote diagnostics, USP operations, VoIP services, and storage services.
- **Web Interface**: Accessible via `/acs/*` for dashboard, device management, and configuration.
- **Scalability**: Achieved through database optimizations and a high-throughput queue system.
- **Configuration**: Uses Laravel environment variables for all settings.

## Recent Development Progress

### TR-069 CWMP Infrastructure Refactoring (MAJOR SUCCESS âœ…)
- **Critical Discovery**: SimpleXML parser cannot correctly parse CWMP namespace-prefixed elements (cwmp:Inform, cwmp:DeviceId, cwmp:EventCode, etc.) - causing complete TR-069 protocol failure
- **DOMDocument Migration**: Completely refactored TR069Controller from SimpleXML to DOMDocument + DOMXPath with proper namespace registration (`soap`, `cwmp`, `xsi`, `xsd`) for carrier-grade CWMP support
- **Test Infrastructure Overhaul**: Fixed critical phpunit.xml missing APP_KEY encryption; created postTr069Soap() helper; enhanced createTr069Inform() with manufacturer, software_version, hardware_version, events arrays, and parameters; added xmlns:xsi and xmlns:xsd namespace declarations for proper XML Schema support
- **Device Management**: Implemented software_version/hardware_version extraction from Inform DeviceId with database updates; fixed device_parameters storage with correct column names (last_updated); proper provisioning_tasks schema compliance with task_data JSON field
- **Session Model Fix**: Updated Tr069Session::touch() method signature from `touch(): void` to `touch($attribute = null)` for Laravel 11 compatibility; corrected all test cookie names from CWMP_SESSION to TR069SessionID
- **Security Fix**: Removed SOAP body logging that exposed ConnectionRequest credentials (username/password) - critical security vulnerability eliminated
- **ConnectionRequest Enhancement**: Migrated from Guzzle direct client to Laravel Http::withDigestAuth() for proper test mocking and cleaner codebase
- **Status Enum Alignment**: Fixed ProvisioningTask status values to match database enum ('processing' instead of non-existent 'in_progress')
- **Test Results Final**: InformFlowTest **7/7 PASSING (100%)**, ConnectionRequestTest **6/7 PASSING (86%)**, ParameterOperationsTest **3/7 PASSING (43%)**
- **Overall TR-069 Coverage**: **16/21 tests passing (76%)** - improved from 24% initial state (+217% increase!)
- **Remaining Limitations**: Response handlers (GetParameterValuesResponse, SetParameterValuesResponse, Download, TransferComplete) return 400 errors - SimpleXML code paths require DOMDocument migration when tested; ConnectionRequest digest auth test expects visible Authorization header (Http::withDigestAuth() hides internal implementation)
