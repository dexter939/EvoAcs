# Sistema ACS (Auto Configuration Server)

## Overview
The ACS (Auto Configuration Server) project is a carrier-grade system built with Laravel 11, designed to manage over 100,000 CPE (Customer Premises Equipment) devices. It supports a comprehensive suite of protocols including TR-069 (CWMP), TR-369 (USP), TR-104 (VoIP), TR-140 (Storage), TR-143 (Diagnostics), TR-111 (Device Modeling), TR-64 (LAN-Side Configuration), TR-181 (IoT Extension), TR-196 (Femtocell), and TR-135 (STB/IPTV). Its core functionalities include device auto-registration, zero-touch provisioning, firmware management, and advanced remote diagnostics. The business vision is to deliver a highly scalable and performant solution for large-scale device management in telecommunication environments.

## User Preferences
I prefer clear and concise explanations. When making changes, prioritize core functionalities and ensure backward compatibility. I prefer an iterative development approach, focusing on delivering functional components incrementally. Please ask for confirmation before implementing significant architectural changes or altering existing API contracts. Ensure all new features have comprehensive test coverage. I want the agent to use proper markdown formatting in all its responses.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The web interface uses the Soft UI Dashboard Laravel template, providing a modern, responsive design with navigation and real-time statistics. It includes 12 statistics cards and 4 interactive Chart.js visualizations. Device management features filtering, pagination, and modal forms for CRUD operations. The dashboard auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.

- **TR-135 (STB/IPTV) Support**: Set-Top Box provisioning.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with optimized indexes, supporting multi-tenancy.
- **Asynchronous Queue System**: Laravel Horizon with Redis queues for provisioning, firmware deployment, and TR-069 requests.
- **API Security**: All API v1 endpoints are protected using API Key authentication.
- **RESTful API (v1)**: Provides authenticated endpoints for device management, provisioning, firmware, and various TR protocol operations.
- **Web Interface**: Accessible via `/acs/*` for dashboard, device management, and configuration.
- **Scalability**: Achieved through database optimizations and a high-throughput queue system.
- **Configuration**: Uses Laravel environment variables for all settings.

### Feature Specifications
